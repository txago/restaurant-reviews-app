# Restaurant Reviews App
This is the fifth project from the **Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree** by **Udacity**. It's a responsive **progressive web app** with a list of **restaurant reviews** that **works offline**.

## Overview
I was provided a code with **lots of issues** for a restaurant reviews website. My job was to **update the code to resolve these issues**, while still maintaining the content and **adding an extra offline functionality**.

## Requirements
In order to meet the approval criteria, I was asked to:
- **Make the provided site fully responsive** for mobile, tablet and desktop;
- **Make the site accessible** with alternative texts for images and semantic markup;
- **Cache the static site** for offline use using Cache API and ServiceWorker.

## How to run the app
You may **visit it online** [here](https://txago.github.io/restaurant-reviews-app/) or follow the instructions below to **run it in a local server**.

1. Download or clone this repository in your terminal by using `$ git clone git@github.com:txago/restaurant-reviews-app.git`

2. Access the folder and check the **Python version** that is installed in your computer by using the command `$ python -V`. Relax, you don't need to know Python.
   - If you have **Python 2.x**, spin up the server with `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use).
   - For **Python 3.x**, you can use `$ python3 -m http.server 8000`.
   - If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   - **For Windows systems**, Python 3.x is installed as python by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter python `$ -m http.server 8000`.

3. With your server running, access the URL `http://localhost:8000` in your favorite browser.
